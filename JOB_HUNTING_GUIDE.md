# Complete Job Hunting Toolkit

This toolkit provides a comprehensive set of tools for your job search journey, from resume processing to job applications tracking. These tools work together to make your job search process more efficient and effective.

## Quick Start

The easiest way to get started is to use the all-in-one script:

```bash
./get_job_ready_complete.sh your_resume.pdf
```

This will:
1. Process your resume with our optimized OCR
2. Extract key skills from your resume
3. Give you access to job search, application, and tracking tools

Alternatively, use the main command-line tool:

```bash
python3 job_hunter.py --help
```

## Available Tools

### 1. Resume Processing

```bash
python3 job_hunter.py process --resume your_resume.pdf
```

Extract high-quality text from your resume PDF using our optimized OCR pipeline specifically designed to fix common recognition issues in resumes.

### 2. Job Search

```bash
python3 job_hunter.py search --keywords Python Developer --location "Remote"
```

Search for job listings across multiple job boards based on keywords and location. The tool will analyze how well each job matches your resume.

### 3. Job Application Tracking

```bash
python3 job_hunter.py track
```

Track your job applications, including status updates, interview scheduling, and notes.

### 4. Application Creation

```bash

```

Create and manage job applications, including generating tailored resumes and cover letters.

### 5. Complete Job Application Assistant
