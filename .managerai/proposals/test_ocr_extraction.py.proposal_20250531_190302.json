For example, maybe the original code had 'from ...' and then tried to define a new class. But the user's proposed modification seems to be adding a new class definition for PDFExtractor, which would overwrite the imported one. That's a problem.\n\nWait no. The original code says: from src.utils.pdf_extractor import PDFExtractor. So in the original file, PDFExtractor is a class or function being imported. So when modifying lines 24-26 (original code), perhaps the user wants to add the class definition again, but that's incorrect if the original code already imports it.\n\nThis suggests that maybe there was a mistake in how the code was structured. Perhaps the user intended that the PDFExtractor is a base class, and then in their modification, they are adding methods to this class. But if the original code's PDFExtractor is from a module, adding a new class here would be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in line numbers. For example, maybe the original code's line 24-26 was the import statement, and the proposed change is to replace that with the class definition plus the import. But that's not correct either.\n\nHmm, this part is confusing. Let me recheck the original code:\n\nOriginal code has:\n\nsys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))\nfrom src.utils.pdf_extractor import PDFExtractor\n\nSo in the script, PDFExtractor is imported from src.utils.pdf_extractor. The class must be defined in that module.\n\nThe proposed modification for lines 24-26 says:\n\nmodify lines 24-26 to:\n\nfrom src.utils.pdf_extractor import PDFExtractor",

      "text": "\n\nclass PDFExtractor:\n\nSo this would overwrite the existing PDFExtractor with a new one, which is wrong. Unless the user's intention was to add a method to the existing PDFExtractor class. But the way the code is written here adds a new class, which would cause an error.\n\nWait no. If in the original code, the PDFExtractor is imported from the module, then in the modified code, the script is now defining a new PDFExtractor class in the same namespace. That's a problem. So perhaps this part of the user's proposed changes is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to inherit from the existing PDFExtractor and add a new method. For example:",

      "text": "\n\nclass PDFExtractor(PDFExtractor):\n\nBut that's not possible. Or perhaps the user wants to augment the existing class with a new method. That would be better.\n\nSo perhaps the correct way is to add the new method _order_text_sequentially to the PDFExtractor class, which is imported from the module. So in the code change, instead of replacing the import line, we should add the new method definition to the existing class.\n\nBut according to the user's proposed changes, in the second modification (start_line 24-26), the new_code is:\n\nfrom src.utils.pdf_extractor import PDFExtractor",
