  "task": "Better Date Pattern Handling:\n\nInstead of using test-specific cases, develop more robust regex patterns that can handle all date format variations\nImplement more general date normalization functions that work with real-world resume text\nPattern Optimization:\n\nFurther optimize pattern matching to reduce processing time\nGroup related patterns together for more efficient processing\nUniversal Pattern Library:\n\nMove pattern definitions to a dedicated configuration file\nCreate a pattern library that can be easily updated and maintained\nTest Coverage Expansion:\n\nAdd more real-world test cases from different resume formats\nImplement property-based testing for validating pattern fixes\nPerformance Profiling:\n\nMeasure the impact of each pattern fix on processing time\nIdentify and optimize patterns with the highest performance impact",
